# Energy Potential Diffusion Simulation

The heterogeneous conformations of a biomolecule (e.g. protein or DNA) are often described by an one-dimensional energy landscape. In this landscape conformational states are wells separated by energy barriers. This representation alows the simulation of interconversion dynamics between these states by diffusion within the energy landscape. 

In this simulation package various energy landscapes, such as
