# Energy Potential Diffusion Simulation

The heterogeneous conformations of a biomolecule (e.g. protein or DNA) are often combined in an one-dimensional energy landscape. In this energy landscape conformational states are represented by wells at different reaction coordinates. These wells are separated by energy barriers limiting the interconversion dynamics. Conformational changes are then understood as diffusion within the energy landscape.

In this simulation package a
